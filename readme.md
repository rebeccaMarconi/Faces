# Faces
_Rebecca Marconi_
_Made with Processing_


This project aims to describe identity and individuality as a simple set of characteristics. Head diameter, pupil size, eye height and color are randomized within a range. By grouping the sets by color ranges it creates a unified emotion among the group. The layering of the faces suggests many people being squeezed together in a crowded space.
